# BasketBall-Detection

This is a small playground project, inspired by other online versions. This model learned to detect a basket and trace it. The decimal on the box indicates the predicted accuracy of the detection with 1.00 being 100%. I fed a variety and hundredres images of basketball for the machine learning model to learn. Below is an example of my friend with a basketball which the model has never seen before. The first clip is the original video that was fed into the model and the second clip is the predicted video that the model trained for 11 epochs.
